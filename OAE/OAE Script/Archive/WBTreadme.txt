The following sequence is done every time you want to (re-)calibrate Titan for absorbance measurements. 
Note the previous calibration data is overwritten. If you want to save old calibration data save file 'Calibration_data_adult.mat' and 'Calibration_data_infant.mat' to another folder.

To run the WBT level calibration
1) Start Matlab 
2) Run the file 'i3WBTlevCal.m' in the 'ResearchSystem' folder in Matlab command window
3) Follow the instructions in the command window. 

1) Start Matlab 
2) Run the file 'i3WBTcal.m' in the 'ResearchSystem' folder in Matlab command window
3) Follow the instructions in the command window. Make sure you have the Interacoustics WBT calibration cavities (NOT the long tubes in the suitcase).

The following sequence is done every time a non-pressurized absorbance measurement is required
1) Start Matlab
2) Insert probe in ear
3) Run the file 'i3WBTabs.m' in the 'ResearchSystem' folder in Matlab command window

The following sequence is done every time a 3DT (pressurized absorbance) measurement is required
1) Start Matlab
2) Insert probe in ear
3) Run the file 'i3WBT3DT.m' in the 'ResearchSystem' folder in Matlab command window

The following sequence is done every time a middle ear muscle reflex (MEMR) measurement is required
1) Start Matlab
2) Insert probe in ear
3) Run the file 'i3WBTreflex.m' in the 'ResearchSystem' folder in Matlab command window
