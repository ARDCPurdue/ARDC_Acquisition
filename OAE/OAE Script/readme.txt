Note:It is recommanded to have the Titan suite installed on the computer
	 The system is tested to work on Matlab version R2016a, earlier versions does not work!

The following sequence is to be done only the first time you connect the research system with your Titan. 
Note: in order to update fimrware, a WBT and research license is required on the device. Run LicenseUpdater is needed. 
1) Download folder 'ResearchSystem' to your local drive
2) Connect the USB cable to Titan and turn on the Titan
3) Start Matlab
4) Run the file 'FirmwareUpdater' in the 'ResearchSystem' folder in Matlab command window


To run the HelloWorld example
1) Start Matlab 
2) Set the probe in a cavity or ear
3) Run the file 'i3HelloWorld.m' in the 'ResearchSystem' folder in Matlab command window
4) Follow the instructions in the command window. 


To run the WBT level calibration
1) Start Matlab 
2) Run the file 'i3WBTlevCal.m' in the 'ResearchSystem' folder in Matlab command window
3) Follow the instructions in the command window. 

Note: To go back to the normal firmware, open and connect the Titan with the Titan suite. Accept up/down-grade firmware.
